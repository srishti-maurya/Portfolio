            <span class="quote"> <em><italic> It is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody else’s life with perfection.

               In today’s world where everybody is trying to create an impact and serve our community to be a better place, we should never forget our roots; Every generation begins its journey from the shoulders of the previous generation and not from scratch. 
               
               Maybe nobody is bad but it’s just their side of story that is unknown to us that we feel they maybe bad. Maybe in someone else’s story we must be the bad one too! Before passing a judgment for anyone, first we should try to understand the story/ behaviour of the person from their point of view too. Judging a book by its cover may not be the best way to judge it rather we should read each chapter and then we would land up to have a new perspective of a situation/ circumference.
               
               Good and evil are two sides of the same coin?
               
               Just because you can’t imagine it, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. We should believe the theory that gives us peace and reject the one that causes us pain. We try to live up to what we think others think of us, even at the expense of our values. 
               </p><p><span class="quote"><em><italic> I am not what I think I am, and I am not what you think I am. I am what I think you think I am.

               I firmly believe that we should be like water, be it in any situation the water moulds itself and takes the shape of the vessel it is put into.
