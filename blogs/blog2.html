          <p><span class="quote"> <em><italic>  Karma simply means we have created the blueprint for our lives. It means we are the makers of our own fate. When we say “This is my karma,” we are actually saying “I am responsible for my life.”
            -Karma : Sadhguru</italic></em></span></p>

           In this fast moving self-centred world every individual is busy doing something that sometime the individual is also not aware why is he/she doing it. Just because of the trend in the market for a job, a course, an industry or field, people now-a-days tend to overlook their talent by comparing it with others and at the end, are left with disturbed mindfulness.
           
           Usually when we try hard to work onto something and then if it does not creates a difference in our life within short duration of time or rather in the duration that we had expected, we tend leave to it and switch to work on other stuff. During this situation we forget the value of atomic habits and work that we do daily. 
           
           While we are working on something, we expect the result to be perfect otherwise we will be disappointed by the results we get but sometimes it’s about realizing that while there’s always a better way to do something, this doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy and appreciate the way things already are.
          </p>
          <p><span class="quote"> <em><italic>  The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.
            – Atomic Habits : James Clear</italic></em></span></p>
           <p>
           
           It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the precious work we have done. However, this work was not wasted . It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.
           
           We should try to Make peace with imperfection because perfection is an illusion.
